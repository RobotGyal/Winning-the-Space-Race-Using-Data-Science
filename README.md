## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.


"In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this module, you will be provided with an overview of the problem and the tools you need to complete the course."


## üèÅ Goals <a name = "goals"></a>

- Develop Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas data frame
- Convert a JSON file into a Create a Python Pandas data frame by converting a JSON file

## ‚õèÔ∏è Built Using <a name = "built_using"></a>

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
  
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK.
  
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
  
- [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) - Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.
  
- [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) - Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
  
- [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/) - Folium makes it easy to visualize data that‚Äôs been manipulated in Python on an interactive leaflet map. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing rich vector/raster/HTML visualizations as markers on the map.

- [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) - Dash is the original low-code framework for rapidly building data apps in Python.

- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) -scikit-learn is a free and open-source machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
